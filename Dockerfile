# PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 Don't create and write .pyc files. Saves disk space in docker, since we don't need bytecode cache
# PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1 Don't buffer output, so logs are immediately flushed to the console. This is important for real-time logging in docker containers.
# UV_COMPILE_BYTECODE=1 Tells UV to compile bytecode when installing dependencies. This can improve performance by pre-compiling the dependencies, so they don't need to be compiled at runtime.
# UV_LINK_MODE=copy Tells UV to copy dependencies instead of symlinking them.

# Install system-level packages we need.
#
# - apt-get update : refreshes the package list.
# - ca-certificates : needed for secure HTTPS requests so it's SSL certificates to make HTTP requests (OPENAI API etc..)
# - curl for health checks and debugging.
# - --no-install-recommends : don't install optional/suggested packages (keeps the image smaller).
# - rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* : delete the package cache. Saves ~30 MB.
